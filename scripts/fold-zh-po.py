"""The po fold — merge the fresh rut.pot into docs/po/zh_CN.po.

Merge law (the GLOSSARY contract, after the 432ace9 lesson):
- entries in POT order; the header rides from the existing zh_CN.po;
- an UNCHANGED msgid keeps its msgstr byte-for-byte;
- a CHANGED msgid whose diff is exactly the mechanical cutover
  (rut.json → rut.jsonc, wire v7→v9 / v8→v10) carries the old msgstr
  through the SAME mechanical substitution — the zh text moves with
  the file name and the wire numbers, nothing else;
- everything else new/changed: FRESH below (written against
  docs/po/GLOSSARY.md) or "" — the English fallback BY DESIGN, never
  a stale zh sentence. Code blocks fold to "" (the untranslated set
  is code-only — 596f61a's doctrine).

Run:  python3 scripts/fold-zh-po.py            (writes docs/po/zh_CN.po)
Then: python3 scripts/po_assert.py             (THE ASSERTION)

# non-mechanically: the Option/Result paragraph in
# builtin-generic-types.md — the spellings diagnose as ordinary
# unknown names now, and the stdlib.md migration table carries the
